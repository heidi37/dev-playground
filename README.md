# dev-playground
A place to practice front end web dev, html, css, javascript.

I started with a blank canvas and I am not working with a logical plan, more of a stream of consciousness project.

I think of something I want to code or practice. Do it and then think about how I could do it better or what I want to do next.

You will notice you can click through each iteration on the bottom under "Progress". I know at some point there will probably be too many link buttons. Unmanageable.

I have taken a lot of classes, done tutorials, but what I really need is just hands on coding and practice working with Git and GitHub.

I am posting some of my learnings on [dev.to](https://dev.to/heidi37)

Here is the link to the latest deployment: https://heidi37.github.io/dev-playground/index.html
